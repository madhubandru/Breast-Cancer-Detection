### Problem Statement
Among many cancers, breast cancer is the second most common cause of death in women. Early detection and early treatment reduce breast cancer mortality. Mammography plays an important role in breast cancer screening because it can detect early breast masses or calcification regions.

### Objective 
Build a machine learning model to detect breast masses and calcification region.


The dataset contains breast mammography images.

 

The dataset can be downloaded from the given link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12umDKmXJ8--ZmuiTrchSQRCs8SmRl12h/view?usp=sharing

From the above link you will be able to download a zip file named ‘mammography_images.zip’. After you extract this zip file, you will get four files:

* train - contains all the images that are to be used for training your model.

* Training_set.csv - this csv file has contains the labels for the training images

* test - contains 1900+ images. For these images you are required to make predictions whether the density is 1,2,3, or 4 and the cancer is benign or malignant.

* Testing_set.csv - this is the order of the predictions for each image that is to be submitted on the platform. Make sure the predictions you submit are with their image’s filename in the same order as given in this file.

* sample_submission: This is a csv file that contains the sample submission for the data sprint.
